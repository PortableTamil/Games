USB Sudoku Pre-Alpha Release # 2 - Changes

o Fixed a game time formatting bug.
o Fixed a 2k minimum window width bug.
o Unicode support has been added with the addition of the USBSudokuUC.exe file.
o Locale support has been added. An example file has been provided. Please see
  it for details on how to make your own locale.ini file for use with your
  language of choice.
o Manual game font selection has been added. Please see the example USBSudoku
  ini file for the steps necessary to get your game fonts changed to those of
  your choosing.
o Usage of a "backfixed.bmp" file has been added, so that, as the puzzle is
  solved, this bitmap is revealed in the "fixed" and "solved" cells. This should
  be a square bitmap and will be stretched to the size of the game window as
  needed.

o Navigating around the grid (highlighting a specific cell) (keyboard):
  o Left, right, up, and down arrow keys will move the cell "cursor" by single
    cell increments, wrapping as necessary (up/down do not wrap, left/right will
    wrap unless the cell cursor is within the top-left or bottom-right cell)
  o Tab will move the cell cursor "forward" by a sub-grid, wrapping as
    necessary)
  o Shift tab will move the cell cursor "backward" by a sub-grid (wrapping as
    necessary)
  o Home will move the cell cursor to the top-left     cell
  o End  will move the cell cursor to the bottom-right cell
