Jooleem 0.1.4
=============

http://jooleem.sourceforge.net/


== Introduction ==
 Jooleem is a simple yet extremely addictive puzzle game. There is only one 
rule: click on four marbles of the same color that form a rectangle. Time is 
constantly running out, but you can earn time (and points) by forming 
rectangles. The larger the rectangle, the more time and points are won.
 Jooleem is free and open source software.

== Controls ==
Left click - Selects a marble. Selecting an already selected marble deselects it.
Right click - Deselects the currently selected marbles.
P - Pauses the game.
H - Hint.
F12 - Takes a screenshot. The file can be found in the "data/screenshot" folder.
Esc - Quits the game.

== Tips ==
* When stuck, click the hint button. But beware - you will pay a time penalty.
* Fill up the time bar to advance to the next level. The higher the level, the 
more points you get per marble.
* The higher the level, the tougher the game. You earn less and less time per 
marble as the game progresses.
