Conrad Rotondella at pocketfuel.com - for letting me use his excellent music
loops in my game.

All sounds are from flashkit.com. Only sounds with the license of Freeware
were used for this game.

The Snake Skin blocks came from a tutorial by Marin Laetitia (titix) on the
Gimp User Group web site (gug.sunsite.dk).

The fading effect for menu/screen changes came from Bernhard Bliem's Wheep game
(wheep.sourceforge.net).
 
Michael Westerlund for the ideas to use the left & right mouse buttons on the
Insane mode as well as bonus scoring for multiple pairs of the same color.

Iris Bussey for the idea of having gravity as an option similar to Shisen-Sho.
