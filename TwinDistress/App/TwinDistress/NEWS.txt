1.1.0:

 New features:
 -another mode of play with gravity is now in the game (thanks for the idea
  Iris). When blocks are removed from the screen, those above them will fall in
  its place.
 -removing multiple sets of the same color in a row will reward you with bonus
  points (thanks for the idea Michael).
 -you will receive bonus points if you play a level without making any wrong
  moves.
 -the harder skill levels have been made more challenging - the Insane skill
  mode from v1.03 is now the Hard skill. Blocks will randomize several times in
  a level on Very Hard & both mouse buttons are required to remove blocks on
  Insane (thanks for the idea Michael). Half of them require using the right
  mouse button & the other half require the left.
 -the game screen has been redesigned to fit 800x600 instead of 640x480. In
  addition to a cleaner game screen, it was mainly done to prepare for network
  play in a future release (for two game grids side by side).
 -a new block set (brushed metal) has been added & made the default.
 -a better way to highlight the blocks has been added. 
 -a fading effect for menu/screen changes was added.
 -bmp graphics are available for those who don't have the libpng library.
 
 Bugs fixed:
 -some games on Insane would still have a block left on the screen at the end
  of the level (thanks Kim).
 -in Windows full-screen mode, the mouse wouldn't move when applying the bonus
  or ending a game (thanks Gabriel).
 -starting a level after the first one could cause a delay in highlighting a
  block (thanks Cluney).
 -pressing Alt-F4 in Windows wouldn't close the game.
 -if a block was highlighted when the game was over, it would (internally)
  have that block highlighted in the next game.
 
1.03:
-changed the way blocks are put back on the screen when you make a wrong move
 in the Insane mode (now randomized instead of the last two blocks). File
 permissions were modified in the Makefile for Linux. All of the text files for
 the source code release were changed from the CRLF pairs to just an LF (thanks
 Kevin!)
 
1.02:
-discovered that when SDL_mixer isn't installed & you build the game with
 'make noaudio'; it won't compile at all. Added the necessary checks to prevent
 this from happening (thanks Lydia!)

1.01:
-fixed two bugs where it wouldn't change the block set after reading the
 saved options & not changing the block set at all after installing the game
 under Linux (thanks for the info. BluEyes!)

1.0:
-initial public release
