<p>
This install bundles the set of WinBoard and support programs,
such as a tournament manager, UCI adapter, opening book,
sample WinBoard and UCI engines.
All pre-installed and ready to run,
in order to provide an example for how things can be done.
In addition the Gold-Pack installer contains components only of interest to users that fit a profile of specific interests.
The Xiangqi profile supplies graphics and engines, which you probably don't want if you are not interested in Chinese Chess.
Similarly, the Chess-Variants profile contains a few engines that you would only use if you are interested in games like
Chess960, Crazyhouse, Loser/Suicide Chess, Gothic Chess, Shatranj, Atomic Chess, etc.
New is that there now also is a Shogi profile, with an engine for shogi and mini-Shogi.

WinBoard 4.5.0 has many new features compared to WinBoard 4.4.4.
Amongst these are ICS-client improvements (seek graph, dual board for bughouse, game upload),
better handling ofcomments, including support for variation trees,
and the possibility to play out engine PVs on the board and automatically annotate games with them.
Seirawan Chess was added as a new variant.
For an elaborate description of the new features,
see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/whats_new/4.5.0/">web page</a> at GNU.
